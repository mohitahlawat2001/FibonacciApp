# FibonacciApp

The Fibonacci Sequence, a distinctive mathematical series, is derived by adding the last two numbers in the sequence. Consequently, the numbers within this sequence are positive whole values. Given our understanding of these requirements, it is important to acknowledge that users may occasionally input invalid numbers or characters into our web application.

To address this situation, we will employ Try-Catch Statements, which enable us to detect and handle these invalid inputs appropriately.
